  # Add a root route if you don't have one...
  # We can use users#new for now, or replace this with the controller and action you want to be the site root:
  root to: 'pages#welcome'  
  get 'balances', to: 'pages#balances'

  # sign up page with form:
  get 'users/new' => 'users#new', as: :new_user

  # create (post) action for when sign up form is submitted:
  post 'users' => 'users#create'


  # log in page with form:
  get '/login'     => 'sessions#new'

  # create (post) action for when log in form is submitted:
  post '/login'    => 'sessions#create'

  # delete action to log out:
  delete '/logout' => 'sessions#destroy'
end
